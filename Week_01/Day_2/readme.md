# Docker Exercise
This assignment was an introduction to docker, teaching us:
- About the Dockerfile
- How to build images
- How to run containers
- What docker-compose is
- How to tag images and upload them to a puplic docker repo.
- And more!

## What is Docker?
Docker is a software technology providing Operating-system-virtualization. 

## What is the difference between:
* Virtual Machine
* Docker Container
* Docker Image

A virtual machine emulates the whole computer system, while a docker container is a operating-system-virtualization built using the resource isolation features of the linux kernel.
A docker image is a static snapshot of binaries, and can vary from being only the OS fundementals to full-built applications, while a container is an instance of an image.

## What is docker-compose:
docker-compose is a tool that allows us to run multi-container Docker applications.

## Results
We have dabbled with docker, creating our first image, uploading it to our docker repo and running it.
